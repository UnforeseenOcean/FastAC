# FastAC - Amir Said's Arithmetic and Huffman coding library, example code, and documentation

This repo is a clone of Amir Said's FastAC library. I studied this library while creating the arithmetic coding routines in the LZHAM codec. It's a very educational, high quality library. Unfortunately, it virtually disappeared on the web years ago so I'm putting a copy on github here.
